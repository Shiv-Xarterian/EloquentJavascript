function bind to objects means when function is called as method on a objects
to access properties of object , 'this' keyword used

if u want to call a function while sending a custom object for its lexical scope
-> 
    speak.call(object,parameters);

-> Arrow functions do not correspond with a own 'this'

Prototypes
You can use Object.create to create an object with a specific prototype.

Classes -> A class defines the shape of a type of objectâ€”what methods and properties it has. Such an object is called an instance of the class.

class Rabbit {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
  }
  speak(line) {
    console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
  }
}

Getters, Setter, Statics

Even properties that are accessed directly may hide a method call. Such methods are called getters
 You can do a similar thing when a property is written to, using a setter.

 instanceof -> to check whether the object derived from a class
