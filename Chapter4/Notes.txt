Array->  Data structure to store elements in contiguos manner
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
can access each element like arr[x] -> x is the position from starting

Properties->
    A property is a characteristic or attribute that belongs to an object.

arr.length -> length -> property of the array -> arr
gives the number of total element in the array

Methods-> To make any Change in the array or extract something from the Array


objects-> An array is used to store simple data then come Obejct which used to store Complex data

inbuilt Methods for Object-> delete obj.prop -> delete a property named prop.
Object.keys() -> return an array of Object keys

Object.assign -> To copy properties from one object to another

let object1 = {value: 10};
let object2 = object1; ----- statement 1
let object3 = {value: 10};

console.log(object1 == object2);
// → true
console.log(object1 == object3);
// → false

object1.value = 15;
console.log(object2.value);
// → 15
console.log(object3.value);
// → 10

objects bind together -> change in one lead to another created like statement 1

const score = {visitors: 0, home: 0};
// This is okay
score.visitors = 1;
// This isn't allowed
score = {visitors: 1, home: 1};

How const work here?????

Array Loops -> 
for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){

}

for (let entry of JOURNAL) {
  console.log(`${entry.events.length} events.`);
}
another example -----


shift and unshift -> in array   
    arr.shift()-> remove first element of arr
    arr.unshift(x)-> Put x at first

slice-> 
function remove(array, index) {
  return array.slice(0, index)
    .concat(array.slice(index + 1));                    slice takes first index and the last index
}
console.log(remove(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2));
// → ["a", "b", "d", "e"]

indexof-> find the first index of the given target


You can split a string on every occurrence of another string with split and join it again with join:

let sentence = "Secretarybirds specialize in stomping";
let words = sentence.split(" ");
console.log(words);
// → ["Secretarybirds", "specialize", "in", "stomping"]
console.log(words.join(". "));
// → Secretarybirds. specialize. in. stomping

Rest Operator->
    Basically if u want to recieve a large number of inputs then ucan write as ...arguments and then it become an array of arguments    
        remember not to put any more argument after it

another example max(...numbers);


Math Object-> 
For doign mathematically operations like min or max or PI or random


let say we have an Obj object
we are not sure that this Obj contains a property called xyz

we can write Obj.xyz? means if it is present then do this


JSON
The full form of JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. 

Every property should be in ""
