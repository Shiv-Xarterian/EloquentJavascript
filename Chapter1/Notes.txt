Numbers -> 1 2 3 4 5 6
Js store upto 64bits so there will be a maximum of 2^64 numbers to be store

Arithmetic -> + - * /  other operations with Numbers

Three Special Numbers = Infinity, -Infinity, NaN(Not a Number)

String -> combinations of characters like 'a' , '*' etc.
Can put anything between quotes to make it a char and then store in String

\ -> Help to move to the NextLine

string A + string B = string C (only for + operator)

"Abc" + "Def" = "AbcDef"

`Hi my name is ${name}` -> Strings quoted in `` will be of special type like ${something}, something will be calculating first and then converted into string and then put in the main string

Boolean operator -> true and false

Logical Operator -> || or && etc.

Empty values -> null or undefined -> absence of a meaningful values

Automatic type Conversion -> 
console.log(8 * null)
// → 0
console.log("5" - 1)
// → 4
console.log("5" + 1)
// → 51
console.log("five" * 2)
// → NaN
console.log(false == 0)
// → true

The ?? operator resembles || but returns the value on the right only if the one on the left is null or undefined, not if it is some other value that can be converted to false
-> Check Validity not True/false
